# TTK4155 - Embedded and Industrial Computer Systems Design Project

A computer controlled electromechanical ping pong game. 

It consisted of assembling the hardware components and develop the software for the microcontrollers, making a fully functional embedded computer system for playing ping pong, keeping the score and win!


## Features

-  with Atmega162, and the USB multifunction card:
 Initial assembly, Address decoding and external RAM, A/D converting and joystick input, OLED display and user interface, SPI and CAN controller

 - PCB with several useful components, an Arduino Mega 2560 (Atmega2560), relay circuit for the solenoid on the ping pong board, and a filter for the IR-sensors:

  CAN-bus and communication between nodes, Controlling servo and IR, Controlling motor and solenoid, Completion of the project and extras

- Varying difficulty: Different tuning of PID-controller (position).
- Use of display: menu and trying other advanced features.
